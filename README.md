# Exploring-Blockchain-and-Cryptocurrency
This work is a part of a winter project in IISER Pune under Dr Anindya Goswami. See the details [here](https://sites.google.com/site/anindyagoswami/teaching/w2019)

The discussions on the first week focussed on the basics of the blockchain technology and it's financial and economic implications gloablly, and on different sectors like the pharmaceuticals, supply chains etc and analyzed the vulnerabilities of blockchain in detail.

During the second part of the project, I developed a blockchain based voting system to be used for my college.
