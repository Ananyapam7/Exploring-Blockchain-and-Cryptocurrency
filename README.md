# Exploring-Blockchain-and-Cryptocurrency
This work is a part of a winter project in IISER Pune under Dr Anindya Goswami. See the details [here](https://sites.google.com/site/anindyagoswami/teaching/w2019)

The discussions on the first week focussed on the basics of the blockchain technology and it's financial and economic implications gloablly, and on different sectors like the pharmaceuticals, supply chains etc

We then started with the programming part of the project. I chose to explore MITM and Smart Contracts and have implimented both these concepts in python.
